2. Log in and open the developer tool in the browser (F12).
3. Find the cookie value named `WorkosCursorSessionToken` in Application-Cookies and save it (The value starts with `user_`).

## How to Run

client = OpenAI(api_key="{{{Replace by the WorkosCursorSessionToken value of your account. It starts with user_...}}}",
                base_url="http://localhost:3010/v1")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet",
